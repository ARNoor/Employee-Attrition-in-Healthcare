## Overview

Employee attrition is a significant challenge in healthcare, as high turnover rates can lead to inefficiency and negatively affect patient care. This project utilizes various machine learning models to analyze employee data and predict the likelihood of attrition. Insights from the model can help organizations understand the reasons behind attrition and develop strategies for improving employee retention.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project contains records of healthcare employees, including personal attributes, job roles, working conditions, and performance metrics. Key features include:

- **Age**
- **Department**
- **Job Role**
- **Education Level**
- **Job Satisfaction**
- **Years at Company**
- **Work-Life Balance**
- **Overtime Hours**
- **Attrition Status (Target)**

The dataset used in this project is publicly available and can be downloaded from [Employee Attrition for Healthcare](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jpmiller/employee-attrition-for-healthcare/data).

Alternatively, if you have a different dataset or a custom one, you can replace the link and description with the appropriate information.


## Features

- Predicts the likelihood of employee attrition based on historical data.
- Provides feature importance analysis to highlight key factors driving attrition.
- Includes exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand trends and patterns in the dataset.
- Evaluates multiple machine learning models to find the best performing one for this problem.

## Methodology

The approach taken in this project is divided into several key steps:

1. **Data Collection**: 
   - Employee data from the healthcare sector was collected, including demographic information, job roles, performance metrics, and attrition status.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: 
   - The dataset was analyzed to identify trends, distributions, and missing values. Key features such as overtime, job satisfaction, and work-life balance were explored in detail to understand their relationship with attrition.

3. **Data Preprocessing**: 
   - The data was cleaned and preprocessed. Missing values were imputed, categorical variables were encoded, and features were standardized where necessary.
   - Feature selection techniques were used to identify the most important features for the prediction task.

4. **Modeling**: 
   - Several machine learning models were trained and tuned using the preprocessed dataset. These models include Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Support Vector Machines, and Gradient Boosting.
   - Cross-validation was performed to ensure the models generalize well to unseen data.

5. **Model Evaluation**: 
   - The models were evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC-ROC curve to assess their performance. Feature importance analysis was performed to identify key drivers of employee attrition.

6. **Prediction & Insights**: 
   - The best-performing model was selected to make predictions on new employee data. Insights were generated from the model to help understand the factors contributing to employee attrition.

## Algorithms

Several machine learning algorithms were implemented and compared, including:

- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest Classifier
- Support Vector Machines (SVM)
- Gradient Boosting
- XGBoost

Each model was evaluated based on accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Results

The best-performing model was **[model name]**, with the following metrics:

- **Accuracy**: X.XX
- **Precision**: X.XX
- **Recall**: X.XX
- **F1-Score**: X.XX

Feature importance analysis revealed that the top factors contributing to attrition were:

- Work-life balance
- Overtime hours
- Job satisfaction

These insights can be used to implement strategies that may improve employee retention.
